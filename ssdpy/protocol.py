    Create an M-SEARCH packet using the given parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    host : str
        The address (IP + port) that the M-SEARCH will be sent to.
        This is usually a multicast address.

def create_notify_payload(host, nt, usn, location=None, al=None, max_age=None):
    """
    Create a NOTIFY packet using the given parameters.
    Returns a bytes object containing a valid NOTIFY request.

    The NOTIFY request is different between IETF SSDP and UPnP SSDP.
    In IETF, the 'location' and 'al' fields serve the same purpose, and can be
    provided together (if so, they should point to the same location) or not at
    all.
    In UPnP, the 'location' field MUST be provided, and 'al' is ignored.
    Sending both 'location' and 'al' is the more widely supported option. It
    does not, however, mean that all SSDP implementations would accept a packet
    with both. Therefore the option to send just one of these fields (or none at
    all) is supported.
    If in doubt, send both. If your notifications go ignored, opt to not send 'al'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    host : str
        The address (IP + port) that the NOTIFY will be sent about.
        This is usually a multicast address.
    nt : str
        Notification type. Indicates which device is sending the notification.
    usn : str
        Unique identifier for the service. Usually this will be composed of a
        UUID or any other universal identifier.
    location : str
        A URL for more information about the service. This parameter is only valid
        when sending a UPnP SSDP packet.
    al : str
        Similar to 'location', but only supported on IETF SSDP, not UPnP.
    max_age : int
        Amount of time in seconds that the NOTIFY packet should be cached by
        clients receiving it. In UPnP, this header is required.
